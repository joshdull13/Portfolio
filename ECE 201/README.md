* ECE 201
	
	The following files are labs created for ECE 201 in Intel Quartus Prime 18.1 for the DE10-Lite Board.
	Files are separated into parts as defined by the lab

## Counters

	Created counters using flip-flops and use counters to implement rotating words on the display.
	
## Finite State Machines

	Implements varying Finite state machines defined in lab requirements
	
## Latches, Flip-Flops, and Registers

	Implementation of RS Latch Circuit, gated D latch, Master-Slave D flip-flop. Use these latches to implement storage and adders.
